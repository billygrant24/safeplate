        "description": "This cleverly named dish, which gets its moniker from the spiky grains of rice that protrude from the meatballs, became popular during the Great Depression, when rice was often added to expensive ground meat as a way to \u201cstretch\u201d it. It\u2019s still a useful budget tip \u2014 or an easy way to eat a little less meat \u2014 and you might find you like these lighter meatballs even better than the traditional sort. Some recipes call for uncooked rice, but using cooked rice ensures that you won\u2019t end up with crunchy grains in an otherwise tender meatball. This recipe uses ground beef, but feel free to swap in ground turkey, pork or chicken. Like most tomato sauce-based dishes, these meatballs freeze well: Cool completely, then transfer to an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge and reheat on the stovetop, covered, over medium-low heat. Serve the meatballs with a simply cooked green vegetable, such as saut\u00e9ed spinach or steamed broccoli.",
